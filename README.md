# Mod3Challenge_Python

Code for two parts of Module 3

Pybank and Pypoll

both parts have a folder (Pybank/pypoll), and within each folder 
  is the main.py python code file, 
  a resources folder containing the spreadsheet
  an analysis folder containing the output .txt file

  When I was writing/running the script, I had my terminal directory open as either "Pypoll" or "pybank" main folder
